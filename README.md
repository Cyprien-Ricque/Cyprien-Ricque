### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my profile !

ðŸŒ± I am a 4th year Epitech student currently in exchange at Tsinghua University.<br>
I uploded some of my Epitech projects on my profile under the name EPITECH-project_name-year.

âš¡My initial education is sofware engineer, also I am really interested in data related fields so I am majoring in data science, machine learning and data engineering. Since I am not sure which one I want to work in yet, I am practicing them all throught Tsinghua University courses, personnal projects, books and MOOCs. 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on "me." project on my free time.
